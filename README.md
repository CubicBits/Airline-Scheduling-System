# Airline Scheduling System
My Computer Science Advanced Programming assignment in Java

## Introduction
This application solves an Airline scheduling problem for allocating which plane an airline uses to fly passengers on each of their flights, and choose which pilots and cabin crew are rostered for each flight.

Because large aircraft weigh more and consume more fuel than smaller ones, airlines try to allocate the smallest aircraft with enough seats to accommodate the booked passengers to a flight. Pilots and cabin crew, however, are only qualified to operate certain types of aircraft. Such “type ratings” can take a considerable amount of time and money to obtain, so it is rare for staff to be qualified to
operate all the types of aircraft that an airline may possess.

The rules governing how long and how often airline staff may work are complex and strict. They are designed to ensure passenger safety, and are negotiated nationally and internationally between pilot and cabin crew unions and government safety agencies. Thus, deciding which type of plane to fly on a particular route on a particular day is a complex decision factoring in passenger demand, the availability of aircraft, and the availability of qualified pilots and cabin crew.

This assignment simulated some of the constraints I could find myself having to working under when developing software in industry. The system operates on data supplied in various formats, as if it were exported from separate existing, so-called legacy systems.

## My Reflection
This project was an enjoyable exercise to consolidate the majority of my understanding in Java (OOP, IO and data interchange formats) and optimse the code and algorithm. My submission was the only mark across the Faculty to achieve 100%.
